# Use Contrast SCA to analyze your code
This GitHub action lets you use Contrast SCA to analyze a projectâ€™s dependencies for vulnerabilities.
- **Supported languages and their requirements:** 
  - **Java:** pom.xml and Maven build platform including the dependency plugin.       
    Or build.gradle and gradle dependencies or ./gradlew dependencies must be     
    supported                                                                     
  - **.NET framework and .NET core:** MSBuild 15.0 or greater and a                   
    packages.lock.json file.                                                      
    Note: If the packages.lock.json file is unavailable it can be generated by    
    setting RestorePackagesWithLockFile to true within each *.csproj file and     
    running dotnet build.
  - **Node:** package.json and a lock file (either .package-lock.json or .yarn.lock.)
  - **Ruby:** gemfile and gemfile.lock
  - **Python:** pipfile and pipfile.lock
  - **Go:** go.mod
  - **PHP:** composer.json and composer.lock
- **CodeSec by Contrast users:** Retrieve authentication details using the command line tool - CodeSec by Contrast.
  - Installation instructions here : [https://www.contrastsecurity.com/developer/codesec](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/developer/codesec)
  - Use the 'contrast auth' and 'contrast config' commands to collect the required credentials.

All Contrast-related account secrets should be configured as GitHub secrets and will be passed to the scanner via
environment variables in the GitHub runner.
A simple workflow to get going is:
```yaml
on:
  # Trigger analysis when pushing to main or an existing pull requests.  Also trigger on
  # new pull requests
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
      types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
name: Common Workflow
jobs:
  analyze_dependencies:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # check out project
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    # Analyze dependencies    
    - name: Contrast SCA Action
      uses: Contrast-Security-OSS/contrast-sca-action@v1
      with:
        apiKey: ${{ secrets.CONTRAST_API_KEY }}
        orgId: ${{ secrets.CONTRAST_ORGANIZATION_ID }}
        authHeader: ${{ secrets.CONTRAST_AUTH_HEADER }}
        apiUrl: ${{ secrets.CONTRAST_API_URL }}
        filePath: .
